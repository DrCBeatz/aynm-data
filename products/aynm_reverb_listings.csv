Its unique attractiveness comes from the series design concept and beautiful figure of ovankol.<br><br>   New bracing pattern, thinner bridge plate    <p>The new CG series features a new bracing pattern that delivers excellent response and rich resonance. These guitars also feature a bridge plate that efficiently transfers string vibration to the guitar top.</p> <ul></ul>      <ul></ul>     Top material  <p>All models in the new CG series lineup are available with either a spruce or cedar top. You can choose the top according to your preferences for tone or wood texture.</p> <ul></ul>       <p>Spruce: Clear fundamental tone. Massive tone with great variation according to touch. Tone improves as the wood matures.</p> <ul></ul>       <p>Cedar: Bright, warm tone. Excellent response with relatively thick treble. Cedar offers a mature tone with little change over time, providing a high level of perfection.</p> <ul></ul>      <ul></ul>     Stable Neck Condition    <p>Necks utilize a strong 3-ply laminate design that resists warping and twisting. This design improves neck strength, offers greater stability against shape changes over time, and allows lower string height. In addition to providing greater neck stability, the laminated design also makes effective use of resources.</p><p>The matte finish on the back of the neck allows the left hand to move smoothly while also providing a secure grip. The finish is applied with a thin coat that contributes to improved resonance. The same matte finish is applied to the bridge for improved resonance.</p> <ul></ul>      <ul></ul>     Saddle fit  <p>Years of experience and original technologies have brought improvements to our saddle and saddle slot design. Crafting these components with great precision provides a highly accurate fit that improves attack and sustain while reducing string vibration loss to transfer rich resonance to the body.</p>   ",,"",Classic,549.99,acoustic-guitars,classical,,https://rvb-img.reverb.com/image/upload/s--E7owXCbq--/v1636582897/f1klqcaxwqdylz7ombrg.jpg,https://rvb-img.reverb.com/image/upload/s--T60R6POW--/v1636582899/p0fzqcb0nw0impedtnxr.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,0.0,,true,FREE Shipping Canada Over $99,,false,04957812472210,false,,https://reverb.com/item/46627300-yamaha-cg162c-solid-cedar-top-classical-guitar,,,46627300,,,,,false,,true,false

In addition to basic functionality such a wide tempo range and a generous number of beats and rhythm patterns, it also provides user-friendly features including an improved display, a loud, crisp sound, and additional functions such as a newly provided “timer mode.” Choose from two different vivid and stylish color schemes for the body: blue and black, or a black and red. The MA-2’s display is 30% larger than that of the previous model, drastically improving the visibility. Within the display, a digital needle moves between left and right, providing a visual indication of the beat in additional to the audible indication. A triangular icon shows the beat position and the timing at which the measure changes. The MA-2 is equipped with a newly designed electronic buzzer.

It provides four mic/line inputs, two of which can alternatively be used for direct input of a guitar or bass, four balanced line outputs, two headphones connectors, and MIDI I/O to your Windows or Mac computer or your iPhone or iPad*. This interface is ideal for multitrack recording of two instruments and two vocalists, for instance, or multi-media production with high demands on simple operation and studio-quality sound. The included loopback function and support for Open Broadcaster Software (OBS Studio), however, makes it also an excellent choice for two-channel podcast creation and live streaming. Lower noise and distortion – better sound than ever The versatile US-4x4HR incorporates a wealth of features, including high audio resolution up to 24-bit/192 kHz, ultra-low latency with a Windows buffer size starting at four samples, Ultra-HDDA mic preamplifiers with 48-volt phantom power for superior sound quality with ultra-low noise, a robust USB Type C connector, and a rich assortment of included software to start producing stunning audio right away. Usability is key All US-HR models offer a unique dye-cast aluminum honeycomb structure on the side panels with a slight upward tilt. This design not only results in a sleek, eye-catching design, it also provides just the right amount of weight so the interface won’t move when cables are connected or disconnected. Equally important, the upward tilt offers the ergonomic benefit of being angled in such a way as to make the interface easy to work with. With four microphone preamps for multi-mic setups, four configurable balanced outputs, superb sound quality and easy operation, the US-4x4HR is the ideal choice for the demanding musician, producer or home-recordist requiring more than two audio channels.  <ul><li>Maximum sampling rate 192 kHz</li><li>Gain range (Mic input) 56 dB</li><li>Equivalent input noise –128 dBu</li><li>Frequency response (Mic/Line input, 96 kHz) 20 Hz – 40 kHz +0 dB / -0.4 dB</li><li>S/N ratio (Mic input) 110 dB</li><li>Distortion (THD+N, Mic input) 0.00%</li></ul> ",,"","",299.0,pro-audio,,,https://rvb-img.reverb.com/image/upload/s--ZbSXdFho--/v1636583151/b7aogvmz105ihbqsbflr.jpg,https://rvb-img.reverb.com/image/upload/s--4osshm-L--/v1636583153/r2il9ikb8qmyd9twkjrs.jpg,https://rvb-img.reverb.com/image/upload/s--SZylz_YC--/v1636583153/xjlyrrzs7m98q9rivlrt.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,,,false,,222.00,false,"",false,,https://reverb.com/item/46627405-tascam-4-in-4-out-usb-c-audio-interface,,,46627405,,,,,false,,true,false

The heat-treated metal ball grille is soldered and welded to the threaded base to form an extremely rugged assembly which can stand up to ten times the shock loading of traditional microphones. In addition to providing protection to the microphone, the grilles also serve to reduce extraneous noise via a multi-stage windscreen.<br><br><b>Design &amp; Components</b><br>The Apex300s cardioid polar pickup pattern that enhances sound isolation by increasing sensitivity in the area in front of the microphone.

Additionally, a cardioid pattern has an enhanced proximity effect(*) which contributes to a fuller sound in most vocal applications. A unique filter incorporated into the capsule design reduces breath noise and the popping caused by explosive consonants such as 'B', 'P' and 'T'.<br><i>*Proximity effect is an increased low frequency response adding fullness and seemingly more 'bottom end' to the voice when microphone is placed close to sound source.

draft,false,"Mano Percussion Cajon With Foam Seat Pad, Ebony Stripes",,Brand New,0,MP-CAJ100-ES,Mano Percussion,"Mano Percussion Cajon With Foam Seat Pad, Ebony","<p>Mano MP-CAJ100-ES is an Ebony Stripes Cajon with Foam Seat Pad. A cajon is a box-shaped percussion instrument originally from Peru, played by slapping the front or rear faces with the hands, fingers, or sometimes various implements such as brushes, mallets, or sticks. Cajones are primarily played in Afro-Peruvian music, as well as contemporary styles of flamenco and jazz among other genres. These instruments can also be used in Latin American Music and Mexican folk music.</p> <br>How to Use: <p><br>The player sits astride the box, tilting it at an angle while striking the head between their knees. The percussionist can play the sides with the top of their palms and fingers for additional sounds. The instrument can also be played with plastic and metal brushes, as used for drum kits. Another way of playing the cajon is to use an ordinary bass drum pedal, thus turning the cajon into an indirect percussion instrument which can be played with the feet. This enables the player to beat it just like a pedal-bass drum, thus leaving the hands (and one other foot) free to play other instruments. On the other hand, it also restricts the player's standard cajon-playing position, as when the cajon is placed on the ground, in the bass drum location, it is hard for the performer to slap it with her or his hands</p> Features:<br> <ul><li>Front plate gauge increased from 9mm to 12mm.</li><li>Attractive Veneer Finishes.</li><li>Comes with Foam Seat Pad.</li><li>Gig bag includes over-the-shoulder strap &amp; backpack carry straps</li><li>Removable, dual-position snare mechanism allows for multiple sound options.</li><li>Color: ES Ebony Stripes</li></ul>",,"",Stripes,169.99,drums-and-percussion,,,https://rvb-img.reverb.com/image/upload/s--Z_CNGdOC--/v1663184788/ud5kgsswaoik3jdjxvn4.jpg,https://rvb-img.reverb.com/image/upload/s--jSF7HbGz--/v1663184790/gmh9jecba5w3an4rvopr.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,,,false,,109.00,false,00694970767133,false,,https://reverb.com/item/60699009-mano-percussion-cajon-with-foam-seat-pad-ebony-stripes,,,60699009,,,,,false,,true,false
